# FrogStepJump

A frog only moves forward, but it can move in steps 1 inch long or in jumps 2 inches long. A frog can cover the same distance using different combinations of steps and jumps. Write a function that calculates the number of different combinations a frog can use to cover a given distance.

For example, a distance of 3 inches can be covered in three ways: step-step-step, step-jump, and jump-step. 

```cs
using System;

public class Frog
{
    public static int NumberOfWays(int n)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException("Waiting to be implemented.");
    }

    public static void Main(String[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(NumberOfWays(3));
    }
}
```
